    abstract = "/genotoxicity/ ... the present study was designed to determine genotoxic and mutagenic effects of bisphenol a (bpa) using in-vivo and in-vitro assays. the adult male and female rats were orally administered with various doses of bpa (2.4 ug, 10 ug, 5mg and 50mg/kg bw) once a day for six consecutive days. animals were sacrificed, bone marrow and blood samples were collected and subjected to series of genotoxicity assay such as micronucleus, chromosome aberration and single cell gel electrophoresis (scge) assay respectively. mutagenicity was determined using tester strains of salmonella typhimurium (ta 98, ta 100 and ta 102) in the presence and absence of metabolically active microsomal fractions (s9). further, we estimated the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, lipid peroxidation and glutathione activity to decipher the potential genotoxic mechanism of bpa. /the investigators/ observed that bpa exposure caused a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleus (mn) in polychromatic erythrocytes (pces), structural chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells and dna damage in blood lymphocytes. these effects were observed at various doses tested except 2.4 ug compared to vehicle control. /the investigators/ did not observe the mutagenic response in any of the tester strains tested at different concentrations of bpa. /the investigators/ found an increase in the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the plasma and increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in glutathione activity in liver of rats respectively which were exposed to bpa. in conclusion, the data obtained clearly documents that bpa is not mutagenic but exhibit genotoxic activity and oxidative stress could be one of the mechanisms leading to genetic toxicity."
